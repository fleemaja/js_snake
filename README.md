# Drunken Snake
[Live Demo]
(http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fleemaja/js_snake/blob/master/html/snake.html)


A javascript version of the classic video game [Snake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)). As a little twist on the game, the game rendering changes depending on whether the snake has become drunk or has made the healthy choice of eating an apple.

The Snake, Board, Apple, Alcohol, and Coord classes are written in js/snake.js and game rendering is done in js/snake-view.js. The rendering is done using divs with CSS classes. Key presses are handled as jQuery events.
